High-performance log deduplication and rate limiting for the Rust `tracing` ecosystem.

> **⚠️ Warning:** This is an MVP release (v0.1.0) with remaining issues. Not recommended for production use without adding input validation and observability. See [Production Readiness Status](#️-production-readiness-status) below.

## Overview

`tracing-throttle` suppresses repetitive or bursty log events in high-volume systems. It helps you:

- **Reduce I/O bandwidth** from repetitive logs
- **Improve log visibility** by filtering noise
- **Lower storage costs** for log aggregation
- **Prevent log backend overload** during traffic spikes

The crate provides a `tracing::Layer` that deduplicates events based on their signature (level, message, and structured fields) and applies configurable rate limiting policies.

## Features

- 🚀 **High Performance**: Sharded maps and lock-free operations
- 🎯 **Flexible Policies**: Count-based, time-window, exponential backoff, and custom policies
- 📊 **Per-signature Throttling**: Events with identical signatures are throttled together
- 💾 **Memory Control**: Optional LRU eviction to prevent unbounded memory growth
- ⏱️ **Suppression Summaries**: Periodic emission of suppression statistics (coming in v0.2)
- 🔧 **Easy Integration**: Drop-in `tracing::Layer` compatible with existing subscribers

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tracing-throttle = "0.1"
tracing = "0.1"
tracing-subscriber = "0.3"
```

## Quick Start

```rust
use tracing_throttle::{TracingRateLimitLayer, Policy};
use tracing_subscriber::prelude::*;
use std::time::Duration;

// Create a rate limit filter with safe defaults
// Defaults: 100 events per signature, 10k max signatures with LRU eviction
let rate_limit = TracingRateLimitLayer::builder()
    .with_policy(Policy::count_based(100))
    .build();

// Or customize the limits:
let rate_limit = TracingRateLimitLayer::builder()
    .with_policy(Policy::count_based(100))
    .with_max_signatures(50_000)  // Custom signature limit
    .with_summary_interval(Duration::from_secs(30))
    .build();

// Add it as a filter to your fmt layer
tracing_subscriber::registry()
    .with(tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer().with_filter(rate_limit))
    .init();

// Now your logs are rate limited!
for i in 0..1000 {
    tracing::info!("Processing item {}", i);
}
// Only the first 100 will be emitted
```

## Rate Limiting Policies

### Count-Based Policy

Allow N events, then suppress all subsequent occurrences:

```rust
use tracing_throttle::Policy;

let policy = Policy::count_based(50);
// Allows first 50 events, suppresses the rest
```

### Time-Window Policy

Allow K events within a sliding time window:

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use tracing_throttle::Policy;

let policy = Policy::time_window(10, Duration::from_secs(60));
// Allows 10 events per minute
```

### Exponential Backoff Policy

Emit events at exponentially increasing intervals (1st, 2nd, 4th, 8th, 16th, ...):

```rust
use tracing_throttle::Policy;

let policy = Policy::exponential_backoff();
// Useful for extremely noisy logs
```

### Custom Policies

Implement the `RateLimitPolicy` trait for custom behavior:

```rust
use tracing_throttle::RateLimitPolicy;
use std::time::Instant;

struct MyCustomPolicy;

impl RateLimitPolicy for MyCustomPolicy {
    fn register_event(&mut self, timestamp: Instant) -> PolicyDecision {
        // Your custom logic here
    }

    fn reset(&mut self) {
        // Reset policy state
    }
}
```

## How It Works

When a log event is emitted:
1. A signature is computed from the event's level, message, and fields
2. The rate limiting policy is checked for that signature
3. The event is either allowed through or suppressed
4. Suppression counts are tracked per signature

Different log messages are throttled independently, so important logs aren't suppressed just because other logs are noisy.

## Memory Management

By default, the layer tracks up to **10,000 unique event signatures**. When this limit is reached, the least recently used signatures are automatically evicted using an approximate LRU algorithm.

**Customizing the limit:**

```rust
// Increase for high-cardinality applications
let rate_limit = TracingRateLimitLayer::builder()
    .with_max_signatures(50_000)
    .build();

// Opt out of limits (use with caution - can cause unbounded growth)
let rate_limit = TracingRateLimitLayer::builder()
    .with_unlimited_signatures()
    .build();
```

**Memory considerations:**
- Each signature uses approximately 100-200 bytes (depends on message length and fields)
- 10k signatures ≈ 1-2 MB memory overhead
- 50k signatures ≈ 5-10 MB memory overhead

The default limit (10k) provides a good balance between memory usage and functionality for most applications.

## Performance

Measured on Apple Silicon with comprehensive benchmarks:

**Throughput:**
- **20 million** rate limiting decisions/sec (single-threaded)
- **44 million** ops/sec with 8 threads
- Scales well with concurrent access

**Latency:**
- Signature computation: **13-37ns** (simple), **200ns** (20 fields)
- Rate limit decision: **~50ns** per operation

**Design:**
- ahash for fast non-cryptographic hashing
- DashMap for lock-free concurrent access
- Atomic operations for lock-free counters
- Zero allocations in the hot path

See [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md) for detailed measurements and methodology.

**Run benchmarks yourself:**
```bash
cargo bench --bench rate_limiting
```

## Examples

Run the included examples:

```bash
# Basic count-based rate limiting
cargo run --example basic

# Demonstrate different policies
cargo run --example policies
```

## Roadmap
